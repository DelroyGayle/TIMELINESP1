                                <h3>Jesus the Messiah</h3>
                                <div class="flex-display">
                                    <p>
                                        During this era, Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, said in Mark 12:29, 
                                        <em>"The first of all the commandments is Hear O Israel! The LORD (namely YAHWEH) our
                                        God, YAHWEH is one."</em> Jesus had quoted the Shema, that is, Deuteronomy 6:4.
                                        In prayer, Jesus said in John 17:3, <em>"You Father, are the Only True God"</em>
                                        In John 8:40, Jesus said of himself, "But now you seek to kill me, <em>a man</em>
                                        who has told you the truth which I heard from God".
                                        In John 20:17, Jesus after he was raised from the dead by God, stated that 
                                        <em>"I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God."</em>
                                        So it is clear that during this era, Jesus presents himself as a man,
                                        who prays to and is distinct from the God of the Jews.
                                        Please note: the terms <em>The Messiah and The Christ</em> are synonymous.

                                <h3>The apostle Paul</h3>
                                <div class="flex-display">
                                    <p>
                                        The apostle Paul (AKA Saul of Tarsus) at his conversion confessed
                                        that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. Paul declared in 1 Timothy 2:5 that
                                        <em>"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, 'the Man' Christ
                                        Jesus."</em>
                                        To the Corinthians, Paul declared <em>"There is no other God but one. To us there is
                                        one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus
                                        Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live."</em>
                                        So to Paul, as well as to his Christian audience, there is ONE GOD, the Father;
                                        whilst Jesus the Messiah, is a man and the mediator between the ONE GOD and
                                        humankind.

                                        From this council was produced the Nicene Creed which began by stating
                                        <span>We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of all

                                    <p>The Edict of Thessalonica (also known as <em>Cunctos populos</em>),
                                        issued by Theodosius I, made the Catholicism of Nicene Christians
                                        the state church of the Roman Empire. It condemned other Christian creeds as
                                        heresies of
                                        <em>"foolish madmen,"</em> and authorized their punishment.
                                        It reads: "Let us believe in the one deity of the Father and of the Son
                                        and of the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity.
                                        We order the followers of this law to embrace the name of Catholic Christians;
                                        but as for the others, since, in our judgment they are foolish madmen,
                                        we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics,
                                        and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches.
                                        They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation
                                        and in the second <em>the punishment of our authority</em> which in accordance
                                        with the will of Heaven <em>we shall decide to inflict.</em>"</p>

                                the Roman Emperor Theodosius I; the 'Holy Spirit' was added to the Nicene Creed.
                                The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed declared that "the Lord, the Giver of Life,
                                Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and
                                glorified."
                                Thus finalising the doctrine of the Trinity as known throughout Christendom today.
                                So, a doctrine and creed, which are not mentioned in Scripture was foistered onto
                                Christians, by the aid of the Roman Empire.
