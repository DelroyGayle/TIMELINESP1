                            <h3>Jesus the Messiah</h3>
                            <div class="flex-display">
                                <p>
                                    During this era, Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, said in Mark 12:29,
                                    <em>"The first of all the commandments is Hear O Israel! The LORD (namely YAHWEH)
                                        our
                                        God, YAHWEH is one."</em> Jesus had quoted the Shema, that is, Deuteronomy 6:4.
                                    In prayer, Jesus said in John 17:3, <em>"You Father, are the Only True God."</em>
                                    In John 8:40, Jesus said of himself, "But now you seek to kill me, <em>a man</em>
                                    who has told you the truth which I heard from God."
                                    In John 20:17, Jesus after he was raised from the dead by God, proclaimed
                                    <em>"I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God."</em>
                                    So it is clear that during this era, Jesus presents himself as <em>a man</em>,
                                    who prays to and is distinct from the God of the Jews.
                                    <span>Please note: the terms <em>The Messiah and The Christ</em> are
                                        synonymous.</span>

                            <div class="flex-display">
                                <p>Peter told a crowd of over 3000 people on the Day of Pentecost that Jesus of Nazareth
                                    is <em>a man</em> approved of God. (Acts 2:22)
                                    That God had resurrected Jesus from the dead and that Jesus was elevated to a
                                    position of lordship by God. (Acts 2:36)
                                    Despite this, Peter refers to Jesus as <em>"the Servant of God"</em> four times,
                                    emphasising a clear distinction between God and Jesus. (Acts 3:13,26; 4:27,30)

                            <div class="flex-display">
                                <p>
                                    The apostle Paul (AKA Saul of Tarsus) at his conversion confessed
                                    that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. (Acts 9:20,22) Paul declared in 1 Timothy 2:5 that
                                    <em>"There is one God and one Mediator between God and men, 'the Man' Christ
                                        Jesus."</em>
                                    To the Corinthians, Paul declared <em>"There is no other God but one. To us there is
                                        one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus
                                        Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live."</em>
                                        (1 Corinthians 8:6)
                                    <span>So to Paul, as well as to his Christian audience, there is solely ONE GOD, the Father;
                                    whilst Jesus the Messiah, is the human mediator between the ONE GOD and
                                    humankind.</span>

                                <p>Here is a sample of the kind of statements that the (so-called) church fathers began to make :-

                                    <span>Justin Martyr (100-165) "You would not have denied <em>that He was God</em>,
                                        Son of the only, unbegotten, unutterable God";</span>
                                    <span>Irenaeus of Lyons (130-202) "Christ Jesus is <em>our Lord, and God,</em> and
                                        Savior, and King, according to the will of the invisible Father."</span>

                                <p>Tertullian is perhaps most famous for being the first writer in Latin known to use
                                    the term trinity (Latin: <em>trinitas</em>).
                                    This is his commentary on the majority of the believers in his era: "<em>The simple,
                                        indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned,) who always constitute the
                                        majority of believers</em>, are startled at the dispensation (of the Three in
                                    One), on the ground that their very rule of faith withdraws them from the world's
                                    plurality of gods to the one only true God; ... The numerical order and distribution
                                    of the Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity ... <em>They are constantly
                                        throwing out against us that we are preachers of two gods and three gods</em>,
                                    while they take to themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the
                                    One God;"

                                <p>In a sermon about the Passover, Melito of Sardis makes the following statement: "The one who
                                    hung the earth in space, is himself hanged; the one who fixed the heavens in place,
                                    is himself impaled; the one who firmly fixed all things, is himself firmly fixed to
                                    the tree. The Lord is insulted, <em>God has been murdered</em>, the King of Israel
                                    has been destroyed by the right hand of Israel."<span>In just under two centuries
                                        following the birth of Jesus, Jesus has been identified <em>as the God who was
                                            killed!</em> The departure from biblical teachings was quick and

                                    the state church of the Roman Empire. It condemned other Christian creeds as

                                    <em>"foolish madmen,"</em> and authorised their punishment.
                                    It reads: "Let us believe in the one deity of the Father and of the Son

                                <p>At this council in now Istanbul, Turkey; which was chaired by
                                    the Roman Emperor Theodosius I; the 'Holy Spirit' was added to the Nicene Creed.
                                    The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed declared that "the Lord, the Giver of Life,
                                    Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and
                                    glorified."
                                    Thus finalising the doctrine of the Trinity as known throughout Christendom today.
                                    So, a doctrine and creed, which are not mentioned in Scripture was foisted onto
                                    Christians, by the aid of the Roman Empire.
