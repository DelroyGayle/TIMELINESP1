                                        Claromentis is an intranet software provider company. I started working at the
                                        Brighton office as a Marketing Designer while I was still attending my final
                                        year at
                                        the University of Sussex. My primary responsibilities included creating
                                        corporate

                                        for the company; I re-designed their website, and have created marketing

                                    <p>Since graduating from university, I have also undertaken responsibilities for
                                        designing a product for the company. The roles I have been given have provided
                                        the
                                        perfect opportunity to implement the skills I have gained throughout my higher
