                                <p>Adam Duff was a Unitarian martyr of the fourteenth century.
                                    He denied the Incarnation and the Trinity of Persons;
                                    he was therefore said to be possessed with a diabolical spirit.
                                    He was tried and sentenced to be <em>"burned and hanged in the fire
                                        at Hoggin-green,"</em> near Dublin. The sentence was carried out.

                                        rel="noopener">Ludwig Haetzer</a> (AKA Louis Haetzer) was beheaded on the charge
                                    of blasphemy.
                                    Ludwig, a Swiss, was all intents and purposes, alone in his thought about
                                    the true nature of God <em>"that the Father alone is the true God -
                                        that Christ is not equal to the Father - that there are not three persons in one
                                        God, because God is altogether ineffable, being neither person nor
                                        essence."</em><br />
                                    A man of great learning, he wrote a treatise against the deity of Christ,
                                    but it was soon suppressed. Ludwig was also a composer of many hymns.
                                    There survives the following explicitly anti-Triniarian utterance,
                                    placed in the mouth of God:<br />
                                    <strong>I am He who created all things through His own might.
                                        Thou askest, how many persons am I?
                                        I am one!<br />
                                        I am not three persons, but I am one!
                                        And I cannot be three persons, but I am one!<br />
                                        I know nothing of persons: I alone am the source of all life.
                                        Him who does not know me, I know not;<br />
                                        I alone am!</strong></p>

                                    recorded Polish Unitarian martyr.
                                    An old lady of over eighty years of age. She was burnt in the city of Cracow in
                                    1539.
                                    Before her judges she avowed her view of God in the following language:<br />
                                    <em>"I believe in the existence of One God, who has created all the visible and
                                        invisible world, and who cannot be conceived by the human intellect."</em>
                                    She also denied that Jesus Christ was <em>from eternity</em> the Son of God.
                                    In other words, Jesus the Son of God began his existence in the womb of his mother
                                    (as recorded in Luke 1:30-37) and not before!

                                        was excommunicated from the Anabaptists of Frisia. Why?
                                        On account of his sentiments concerning the Trinity.
                                        <em>He maintained that the Father alone was the true God.</em>
                                        In 1547 whilst in fellowship with the Mennonites, he declared himself a unitarian, 
                                        <em>holding that Christ did not exist as the Son of God before his conception.</em>
                                        He was subsequently excommunicated from that community because of his views of God and Jesus.

                                    during the first half of the sixteenth century.
                                    On his arrival in London he joined the Stranger Church in Austin Friars (pictured).
                                    It is thought he settled in London from having heard "that strangers in England were exempted from
                                    certain penal laws." This he soon learned was not so, for having declared <em>"that God the Father was
                                        the only God, and that Christ was not very (truly) God."</em> He was pronounced "an obstinate heretic"
                                        and was burnt at the stake in Smithfield.</p>

                                    (AKA Miguel Servet, Miguel de Villanueva, 1511 - 1553) was this day, 
                                    burnt alive atop a pyre of his own books at the Plateau of Champel at the edge of Geneva.
                                    Servetus was a Spanish theologian, physician, cartographer, a polymath and the discover of pulminary circulation.
                                    Regarding the Trinity, Servetus wrote the following books: <em>On the Errors of the Trinity, Dialogues on the Trinity and
                                        the Restitution of Christianity.</em> 
                                        Servetus sought to have an open dialogue with John Calvin. 
                                        Calvin vowed that if Servetus was to ever visit Geneva, 
                                        <em>"should he come, if my authority is of any avail, I will not suffer him
                                            to get out alive."</em></br>
                                            Thus, Servetus was burnt alive on the 27th of October, 1553. A strong breeze that sprung up
                                            scattered the flames and kept him in great torture for about half an hour. He was heard to exclaim, 
                                            <em>Jesus, thou Son of the Eternal God, have pity on me.</em> So died this distinguished physician and reformer.
                                            <br/>An eyewitness noted that if he had only moved the adjective "eternal" 
                                            and called <br/>Jesus the "Eternal Son of God," (i.e. a Trinitarian confession)
                                            his life would have been spared.</br>

                                <p>In a sermon about the Passover, Melito of Sardis makes the following statement: "The

                                    hung the earth in space, is himself hanged; the one who fixed the heavens in place,

                                        following the birth of Jesus, Jesus has been identified <em>as the God who was
                                            killed!</em> The departure from biblical teachings was quick and

                                    From this council was produced the Nicene Creed which began by stating

                                <p>Photinus (died 376), was a Christian bishop of Sirmium in Pannonia Secunda (Pictured

                                    None of Photinus' writings exist today; his views are known, however, mostly through
                                    the twenty-seven anathemas of the council in 351 which condemned him.
                                    <span><em>Photinian</em> became a term to describe anyone who held Christ to be
                                        <em>a man,
                                            who did not exist until his birth at Nazareth.</em> (As taught in the

                            <div class="flex-display">
                                <p>The Edict of Thessalonica (also known as <em>Cunctos populos</em>),
                                    issued by Theodosius I, made the Catholicism of Nicene Christians
                                    the state church of the Roman Empire. It condemned other Christian creeds as
                                    heresies of
                                    <em>"foolish madmen,"</em> and authorised their punishment.
                                    It reads: "Let us believe in the one deity of the Father and of the Son
                                    and of the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity.
                                    We order the followers of this law to embrace the name of Catholic Christians;
                                    but as for the others, since, in our judgment <em>they are foolish madmen</em>,
                                    we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics,
                                    and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches.
                                    They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation
                                    and in the second <em>the punishment of our authority</em> which in accordance
                                    with the will of Heaven <em>we shall decide to inflict.</em>"</p>

                                    the Roman Emperor Theodosius I; the 'Holy Spirit' was added to the Nicene Creed.
                                    The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed declared that "the Lord, the Giver of Life,
                                    Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and
                                    glorified."
                                    Thus finalising the doctrine of the Trinity as known throughout Christendom today.
                                    So, a doctrine and a creed, which are not mentioned in Scripture were foisted onto
                                    Christians, by the aid of the Roman Empire.

                                    II. It confirmed the
                                    original Nicene Creed and condemned the teachings of Nestorius, who held that Mary
                                    may be called <em>the Christotokos, "Christ-bearer" but not the Theotokos,

                                    In other words, Christians were compelled by this council to call Mary, <em>"the
